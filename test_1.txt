Pupils were equal and reactive to light.There was a small right subconjunctival hemorrhage.  Noptosis.  Vision was intact.  Trachea was midline.  Heart wasregular rate and rhythm.  Chest had moderate ecchymosis andhematoma forming on her right breast and right flank.  Shehad lacerations with muscle involvement to her chin, rightupper eyelid and above her nose.  Abdomen was soft.  Therewas significant ecchymosis along the lower abdomen from aseat belt injury.  No rebound, no guarding.  Guaiac wasnegative, good rectal tone.  She had abrasions to both knees.Strength was [**6-6**] in all extremities.  Sensation slightlydecreased at the fourth and fifth left fingers.  Cranialnerves were intact.

CT pelvis abdomen no free fluid or traumaticevent.ASSESSMENT:  This is a 58 year old woman status post motorvehicle crash with a large right breast hematoma.  Studiesotherwise negative except for a significant amount ofbleeding into her breast which was increasing in size as wellas subconjunctival hemorrhage and the facial lacerations.HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the SICU forhemodynamic monitoring and had serial hematocrits, serialabdominal exams.  She received IV fluids, pneumoboots andProtonix.  The patient also reported that she was on the wayback from the dentist where she was supposed to starterythromycin for a tooth abscess, so we put her onclindamycin 600 q.eight.  On her admission hospital day herC-spine was attempted to be cleared given that she had CTscan of her neck which did not show any fracture ordislocation.  However, on palpation of the bones of thecervical vertebrae she had tenderness, therefore, the collarwas kept on and neurosurgery was consulted.In the SICU she basically had an uneventful course.  However,her hematocrit did continue to decrease slightly and thepatient had a transfusion of two units given for hematocritless than 25, approximately 23.4.  Facial lacerations weresutured in the emergency department and continued to betreated with bacitracin.  She was on fentanyl patch andNeurontin for pain medications which she tolerated.  Thepatient was found to also have a left fourth finger distalphalanx fracture without displacement and plastic surgery wasconsulted for her hand.  They put her in a splint and gaveher followup instructions.The patient was transferred to the floor with stablehematocrit.  Physical therapy saw her and she was able toambulate without difficulty, without assistance.  C-collarwas in place.  Neurosurgery gave their final recommendations.DISPOSITION:  To home.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improving.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Trauma clinic in one week, phonenumber [**Telephone/Fax (1) 274**], call to schedule the appointment.Neurosurgery: the patient is to continue the C-collar andfollow up with her private neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

There was no loss of consciousness at thattime.  She does report increased frequency of falling at homeover the past three weeks.  She reports feeling weak andtired when she fell in the kitchen when she struck her head.Besides having no loss of consciousness she also reports nomemory deficits.  She had a headache, no nausea or vomiting,neck stiffness in the last two days.In the Emergency Room, a CT scan was performed which showed asmall right frontal subdural hematoma.  In the EmergencyRoom, the patient received Lasix 40 mg IV times one, K-Dur 40mEq times one, vitamin K 10 mg IV times one, and then wasadmitted to the MICU under the Neurosurgery Service.MEDICATIONS AT HOME:1.  Coumadin.2.  Verapamil.3.  Hydrochlorothiazide.ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.  Hypertension.2.  Atrial fibrillation.3.  Bilateral lower extremity edema.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  D&C.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She lives with her husbandat home.  Independent lifestyle.  No tobacco.  No alcoholuse.FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with CHF.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature96.8, pulse 75, blood pressure 135/74, respirations 14, 100%on room air.  General:  Alert and oriented times three,cooperative.  HEENT:  Unequal pupils, left greater thanright, both are reactive to light, atraumatic.  Neurologic:Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Strength:Normal in all extremities.  Sensation intact.  No pronatordrift.  Neck:  Nontender, atraumatic.  Cardiovascular:Irregularly/irregular, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at theleft sternal border.  Lungs:  A few crackles at the bilateralbases, good air movement.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended,nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There was 4+pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities above thehips.INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.5, hematocrit 27.9,MCV 77, RDW 16, platelets 230,000.  The Chem-7 was remarkablefor a potassium of 3.1.  The INR was 2.3.The initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild vascularredistribution.The EKG showed atrial fibrillation.The head CT showed a right subdural hematoma, subacute.ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old female with a history ofhypertension and A fib on Coumadin with a subdural hematomastatus post fall at home.HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  The patient wasoriginally admitted to the MICU under the NeurosurgeryService to follow the patient for one day.  There, in theMICU, the primary concern was lowering the patient's INR fromthe admission INR of 2.3 down to below 1.3 for her subduralhemorrhage.  She was originally given 4 units of FFP witheventual fall of her INR from 2.3 to 1.6.Her MICU course was then complicated by flash pulmonary edemawith A fib and rapid ventricular response.  For this, shereceived additional Lasix as well as a brief course on aDiltiazem drip which broke the RVR.  The patient receivedfrequent neurologic checks and was deemed stable from aneurosurgery standpoint.  They decided that there was no needto evacuate the hematoma at this time and that could befollowed.The patient was given 2 more units of FFP before transfer tothe floor.  On the floor, the patient received 5 mg ofvitamin K.  By the day of discharge, her INR had fallen to1.3.2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was with increasing lowerextremity edema and CHF like symptoms.  The patient was givenmultiple doses of Lasix throughout her hospital course withgood response in diuresis.  The patient also had an episodeof flash pulmonary edema after receiving FFP in the MICU forwhich she received additional Lasix.  She also was in an Afib rhythm throughout her hospital course with one episode ofRVR which had to be controlled with a Diltiazem drip.  Thepatient was then switched from verapamil to Diltiazem p.o.The patient continued to have A fib throughout her hospitalcourse; however, only that one episode of rapid ventricularresponse.  The patient's blood pressure was stable throughoutall times during the hospital course.The patient received an echocardiogram on the day ofdischarge to fully evaluate her heart function which revealeda left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65% and a TRgradient of 25-30 mmHg.  The left atrium was normal in size.Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  Rightventricular wall cavity was markedly dilated with depressedsystolic function.  There was physiologic mitralregurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  There wasborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Nopericardial effusion.Compared with the prior report of [**2160-1-1**], the rightventricle had become dilated and the function decreased.Given this information, it was decided that the patient wouldbe stable for discharge.3.  PT/OT:  The patient was evaluated by the PT and OTService due to her recent increase in falls for her fall riskand also for general deconditioning.  The patient was deemedto be a suitable candidate for acute rehabilitation stay.4.  ANEMIA:  The patient is with known history ofiron-deficiency anemia.  The patient did have a lowhematocrit during her hospital course of 23.6.  The patientreceived 2 units of packed red blood cells and had anappropriate increase in her hematocrit to 29.2.  Herhematocrit thereafter was stable and the patient was startedon iron supplementation therapy.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:1.  Subdural hemorrhage in the right frontal region.2.  General deconditioning with falls.3.  Dilated right ventricle.4.  Iron-deficiency anemia.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.  Cardizem CD 120 mg p.o. q.d.2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.3.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.4.
